    "> __a)__  Hadoop Counters measure the number of operations that occur within the map-reduce job and are useful for gathering statistics about the map-reduce job for quality control and are also useful for problem diagnosis. Counters are a single variable that can be shared across multiple variables. Hadoop task counter collects information (e.g. number of records read and written) about tasks during its execution and are maintained by each task attempt and periodically sent to the application master to be globally aggregated. Information that the counters help capture include: number of bytes read and written by the file system, number of bytes read by map tasks, number of bytes written by map tasks to reduce tasks, the job-level statistics (i.e. not values that change while a task is running). To create a custom counter, we can use the code 'sys.stderr.write(\"reporter:counter: [function...])'\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "> __c)__ order inverstion pattern is a technique by which we sort our systems outputs (e.g. print statement in a python script when called by hadoop) such that information that needs to be loaded logically is read first (e.g. when a reducer receives and output from mapper(s)). This helps prevent logical fallacies in our code like divide by zero errors. We implement this with the prepending of special characters to strings like \"*\" so that the information we want printed first is printed first when we sort the outputs.\n",

    "# Question 3: Understanding Total Order Sort\n",

    "The key challenge in distributed computing is to break a problem into a set of sub-problems that can be performed without communicating with each other. Ideally, we should be able to define an arbirtary number of splits and still get the right result, but that is not always possible. Parallelization becomes particularly challenging when we need to make comparisons between records, for example when sorting. Total Order Sort allows us to order large datasets in a way that enables efficient retrieval of results. Before beginning this assignment, make sure you have read and understand the [Total Order Sort Notebook](https://github.com/UCB-w261/main/tree/master/HelpfulResources/TotalSortGuide/_total-sort-guide-spark2.01-JAN27-2017.ipynb). You can skip the first two MRJob sections, but the rest of section III and all of section IV are **very** important (and apply to Hadoop Streaming) so make sure to read them closely.

    "# Question 7: Naive Bayes Inference.\n",
    "In the next two questions you'll write code to parallelize the Naive Bayes calculations that you performed above. We'll do this in two phases: one MapReduce job to perform training and a second MapReduce to perform inference. While in practice we'd need to train a model before we can use it to classify documents, for learning purposes we're going to develop our code in the opposite order. By first focusing on the pieces of information/format we need to perform the classification (inference) task you should find it easier to develop a solid implementation for training phase when you get to question 8 below. In both of these questions we'll continue to use the Chinese example corpus from the textbook to help us test our MapReduce code as we develop it. Below we've reproduced the corpus, test set and model in text format that matches the Enron data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7 Tasks:\n",
    "* __a) short response:__ run the provided cells to create the example files and load them in to HDFS. Then take a closer look at __`NBmodel.txt`__. This text file represents a Naive Bayes model trained (with Laplace +1 smoothing) on the example corpus. What are the 'keys' and 'values' in this file? Which record means something slightly different than the rest? The value field of each record includes two numbers which will be helpful for debugging but which we don't actually need to perform inference -- what are they? [`HINT`: _This file represents the model from Example 13.1 in the textbook, if you're having trouble getting oriented try comparing our file to the numbers in that example._]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) short response:__ When performing Naive Bayes in practice instead of multiplying the probabilities (as in equation 13.3) we add their logs (as in equation 13.4). Why do we choose to work with log probabilities? If we had an unsmoothed model, what potential error could arise from this transformation?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) short response:__ Documents 6 and 8 in the test set include a word that did not appear in the training corpus (and as a result does not appear in the model). What should we do at inference time when we need a class conditional probability for this word?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) short response:__ The goal of our MapReduce job is to stream over the test set and classify each document by peforming the calculation from equation 13.4. To do this we'll load the model file (which contains the probabilities for equation 13.4) into memory on the nodes where we do our mapping. This is called an in-memory join. Does loading a model 'state' like this depart from the functional programming principles? Explain why or why not. From a scability perspective when would this kind of memory use be justified? when would it be unwise?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __e) code:__ Complete the code in __`NaiveBayes/classify_mapper.py`__. Read the docstring carefully to understand how this script should work and the format it should return. Run the provided unit tests to confirm that your script works as expected then write a Hadoop streaming job to classify the Chinese example test set. [`HINT 1:` _you shouldn't need a reducer for this one._ `HINT 2:` _Don't forget to add the model file to the_ `-files` _parameter in your Hadoop streaming job so that it gets shipped to the mapper nodes where it will be accessed by your script._]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __f) short response:__ In our test example and in the Enron data set we have fairly short documents. Since these fit fine in memory on a mapper node we didn't need a reducer and could just do all of our calculations in the mapper. However with much longer documents (eg. books) we might want a higher level of parallelization -- for example we might want to process parts of a document on different nodes. In this hypothetical scenario how would our algorithm design change? What could the mappers still do? What key-value structure would they emit? What would the reducers have to do as a last step?"

    "### Q7 Student Answers:\n",
    "> __a)__ The keys are the token labels and the values are the conditional probabilities of those tokens given that they belong to chinese class. The one entry that differs is the ClassPriors line, which gives the prior probabilities of the documents in the training set given that they are in the chinese class\n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ We work with log probabilites since the properties of logs allow us to add the probabilities instead of multiplying them, which could quickly result in a floating point underflow error in digital computations if we were to multiply non log transformed probabilities. If we had an unsmoothed model, then a word appears in the testing set but not in the training set will result in the P(word | C=chinese) and P(word | not chinese) = 0. This breaks our probability multiplication equation. Thus we apply smoothing techniques to account for this potential mathematical error. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ Two approaches could be: 1. assign it a value of 1 which means the probability that the word is from the chinese class and not chinese class are equal or 2. we can apply smoothing, which likely will require two MapReduce jobs - one to calculate the vocabulary size using one or more reducers and a second job to calculate the conditonal probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "> __d)__ I think does not practically violate our functional programming princicples as the state of the model that we load into the memory of the node does not chance as we do our mapping. Even though the model has a state, it is practically like loading a function into our mappers. Compared to a large corpous, which may not fit in the memory of one mapper, we likely will be able to fit a naive bayes classifer into memory.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> __e)__ Complete the coding portion of this question before answering 'f'.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __f)__ As the size of our corpous increases, we will need to split the calculation across multiple nodes. Thus for classification, we will need to move the summation from the mapper to the reducer to predict the class.  \n",

    "# Question 8: Naive Bayes Training.\n",
    "In Question 7 we used a model that we had trained by hand. Next we'll develop the code to do that same training in parallel, making it suitable for use with larger corpora (like the Enron emails). The end result of the MapReduce job you write in this question should be a model text file that looks just like the example (`NBmodel.txt`) that we created by hand above.\n",
    "\n",
    "To refresh your memory about the training process take a look at  `6a` and `6b` where you described the pieces of information you'll need to collect in order to encode a Multinomial Naive Bayes model. We now want to retrieve those pieces of information while streaming over a corpus. The bulk of the task will be very similar to the word counting excercises you've already done but you may want to consider a slightly different key-value record structure to efficiently tally counts for each class. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most challenging (interesting?) design question will be how to retrieve the totals (# of documents and # of words in documents for each class). Of course, counting these numbers is easy. The hard part is the timing: you'll need to make sure you have the counts totalled up _before_ you start estimating the class conditional probabilities for each word. It would be best (i.e. most scalable) if we could find a way to do this tallying without storing the whole vocabulary in memory... Use an appropriate MapReduce design pattern to implement this efficiently! \n",

    "### Q8 Tasks:\n",
    "* __a) make a plan:__  Fill in the docstrings for __`NaiveBayes/train_mapper.py`__ and __`NaiveBayes/train_reducer.py`__ to appropriately reflect the format that each script will input/output. [`HINT:` _the input files_ (`enronemail_1h.txt` & `chineseTrain.txt`) _have a prespecified format and your output file should match_ `NBmodel.txt` _so you really only have to decide on an internal format for Hadoop_].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) implement it:__ Complete the code in __`NaiveBayes/train_mapper.py`__ and __`NaiveBayes/train_reducer.py`__ so that together they train a Multinomial Naive Bayes model __with no smoothing__. Make sure your end result is formatted correctly (see note above). Test your scripts independently and together (using `chineseTrain.txt` or test input of your own devising). When you are satisfied with your Python code design and run a Hadoop streaming command to run your job in parallel on the __chineseTrain.txt__. Confirm that your trained model matches your hand calculations from Question 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) short response:__ We saw in Question 6 that adding Laplace smoothing (where the smoothing parameter $k=1$) makes our classifications less sensitve to rare words. However implementing this technique requires access to one additional piece of information that we had not previously used in our Naive Bayes training. What is that extra piece of information? [`HINT:` see equation 13.7 in Manning, Raghavan and Schutze].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) short response:__ There are a couple of approaches that we could take to handle the extra piece of information you identified in `c`: 1) if we knew this extra information beforehand, we could provide it to our reducer as a configurable parameter for the vocab size dynamically (_where would we get it in the first place?_). Or 2) we could compute it in the reducer without storing any bulky information in memory but then we'd need some postprocessing or a second MapReduce job to complete the calculation (_why?_). Breifly explain what is non-ideal about each of these options. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __e) code + short response:__ Choose one of the 2 options above. State your choice & reasoning in the space below then use that strategy to complete the code in __`NaiveBayes/train_reducer_smooth.py`__. Test this alternate reducer then write and run a Hadoop streaming job to train an MNB model with smoothing on the Chinese example. Your results should match the model that we provided for you above (and the calculations in the textbook example). __IMPORTANT NOTE:__ For full credit on this question, your code must work with multiple reducers. \n",

    "> __ c)__ For laplace smoothing, we need information about the total size of the unique vocabulary for each reducer.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __ d)__ If we knew the size of the vocavulary beforehand, we could hard code this as a parameter however the issue is this does not scale if the corpous is too large to preprocess to determine the vocabulary size. If we used two map-reduce jobs, we can calculate this in the hadoop job however this still requires that we use only one reduce job to determine the vocabulary size as well as the added computation time to run two map reduce jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __ e)__ I decided to use the multiple map reduce jobs so to better implement scalable solutions (as in general the single reduce job should be able to the size of the unique dictionary even as the corpous grows whereas the mappers may hit data limitations isssues). I also wanted practice passing one map-reduce job to another. \n"

    "* __a) train/test split:__ Run the provided code to split our Enron file into a training set and testing set then load them into HDFS. [`NOTE:` _Make sure you re calculate the vocab size for just the training set!_]\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) train 2 models:__ Write Hadoop Streaming jobs to train MNB Models on the training set with and without smoothing. Save your models to local files at __`NaiveBayes/Unsmoothed/NBmodel.txt`__ and __`NaiveBayes/Smoothed/NBmodel.txt`__. [`NOTE:` _This naming is important because we wrote our classification task so that it expects a file of that name... if this inelegance frustrates you there is an alternative that would involve a few adjustments to your code [read more about it here](http://www.tnoda.com/blog/2013-11-23)._] Finally run the checks that we provide to confirm that your results are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) code:__ Recall that we designed our classification job with just a mapper. An efficient way to report the performance of our models would be to simply add a reducer phase to this job and compute precision and recall right there. Complete the code in __`NaiveBayes/evaluation_reducer.py`__ and then write Hadoop jobs to evaluate your two models on the test set. Report their performance side by side. [`NOTE:` if you need a refresher on precision, recall and F1-score [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score) is a good resource.]\n",

    "* __d) short response:__ Compare the performance of your two models. What do you notice about the unsmoothed model's predictions? Can you guess why this is happening? Which evaluation measure do you think is most relevant in our use case? [`NOTE:` _Feel free to answer using your common sense but if you want more information on evaluating the classification task checkout_ [this blogpost](https://tryolabs.com/blog/2013/03/25/why-accuracy-alone-bad-measure-classification-tasks-and-what-we-can-do-about-it/\n",

    "> __d)__  The unsmoothed model's precision score is 100% even though all of the other performance metrics are pretty poor whereas the accuracy, recall, and F1 score are much better for the smoothed model but the precision is worst. That is because the smoothed model is predicting more false positives than the regular model - likely due to the behavior of the class priors and the additive properties of increasing the counts of rare words.   \n"

    "* __a) code + short response:__ Let's look at the top ten words with the highest conditional probability in `Spam` and in `Ham`. We'll do this by writing a Hadoop job that sorts the model file (`NaiveBayes/Smoothed/NBmodel.py`). Normally we'd have to run two jobs -- one that sorts on $P(word|ham)$ and another that sorts on $P(word|spam)$. However if we slighly modify the data format in the model file then we can get the top words in each class with just one job. We've written a mapper that will do just this for you. Read through __`NaiveBayes/model_sort_mapper.py`__ and then briefly explain how this mapper will allow us to partition and sort our model file. Write a Hadoop job that uses our mapper and `/bin/cat` for a reducer to partition and sort. Print out the top 10 words in each class (where 'top' == highest conditional probability).[`HINT:` _this should remind you a lot of what we did in Question 6._]\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) short response:__ What do you notice about the 'top words' we printed in `a`? How would increasing the smoothing parameter 'k' affect the probabilities for the top words that you identified for 'a'. How would they affect the probabilities of words that occur much more in one class than another? In summary, how does the smoothing parameter 'k' affect the bias and the variance of our model. [`NOTE:` _you do not need to code anything for this task, but if you are struggling with it you could try changing 'k' and see what happens to the test set. We don't recommend doing this exploration with the Enron data because it will be harder to see the impact with such a big vocabulary_]"

    "> __a)__ The mapper prints a class typer per word in eahc trained NB and strips the word, payload, and class probability for printing. It then partitions on the class type and sorts on the probability such that we can easily see the max probability per class. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ Increasing the smoothing paramter decreases the delta's between probabilities in words. As k increases indefinetly, the conditional probabilities for each word approach the class priors values. For words that show up much more in once class then another, it lessens the impact of this difference as we smooth it out with a signficantly high K value. It would decrease the variance of the model as it relies more heavily on the class priors to make a prediction but increases the bias. \n",
