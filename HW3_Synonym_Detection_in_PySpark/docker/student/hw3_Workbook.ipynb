    "# HW 3 - Synonym Detection In Spark\n",

    "\n",
    "In the last homework assignment you performed Naive Bayes to classify documents as 'ham' or 'spam.' In doing so, we relied on the implicit assumption that the list of words in a document can tell us something about the nature of that document's content. We'll rely on a similar intuition this week: the idea that, if we analyze a large enough corpus of text, the list of words that appear in small window before or after a vocabulary term can tell us something about that term's meaning. This is similar to the intuition behind the word2vec algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be your first assignment working in Spark. You'll perform Synonym Detection by repurposing an algorithm commonly used in Natural Language Processing to perform document similarity analysis. In doing so you'll also become familiar with important datatypes for efficiently processing sparse vectors and a number of set similarity metrics (e.g. Cosine, Jaccard, Dice). By the end of this homework you should be able to:  \n",
    "* ... __define__ the terms `one-hot encoding`, `co-occurrance matrix`, `stripe`, `inverted index`, `postings`, and `basis vocabulary` in the context of both synonym detection and document similarity analysis.\n",
    "* ... __explain__ the reasoning behind using a word stripe to compare word meanings.\n",
    "* ... __identify__ what makes set-similarity calculations computationally challenging.\n",
    "* ... __implement__ stateless algorithms in Spark to build stripes, inverted index and compute similarity metrics.\n",
    "* ... __identify__ when it makes sense to take a stripe approach and when to use pairs\n",
    "* ... __apply__ appropriate metrics to assess the performance of your synonym detection algorithm. \n",

    "> __a)__ Spark is an computing framework that is used to process large scale data. It is open source and has useful APIs for programming in Scala, Python, and Java. Similar to Hadoop's MapReduce framework, Spark reads and processes data using transformations (similar to Maps) and actions (similar to reduce) but has improved performance due to caching.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ Spark observes many properties of functional programming in that it does not modify data but instead always creates new structures and follows a 'lazy' programming design by which nothing will execute until you need the data. It differs from purefly functional programing as Spark allows side effects, meaining changes in state depend on the functions inputs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ A 'DAG' is a Directed Acyclic Graph. 'Transformations' are like maps in that they are functions that are applied to each record in a RDDs (resilient distributed dataset) to output results to a new RDDS. An 'action' is a result oriented function that outputs values. The DAG has the lists of transformations that will occur but again follow a 'lazy' programmign design in that they will only execute when the data is needed. \n",

Jaccard similarity is good for cases where duplication does not matter, cosine similarity is good for cases where duplication matters while analyzing text similarity.\n",

    "In the Synonym Detection task we want to compare the meaning of words, not documents. For clarity, lets call the words whose meaning we want to compare `terms`. If only we had a 'meaning document' for each `term` then we could easily use the document similarity strategy from Question 2 to figure out which `terms` have similar meaning (i.e. are 'synonyms'). Of course in order for that to work we'd have to reasonably believe that the words in these 'meaning documents' really do reflect the meaning of the `term`. For a good analysis we'd also need these 'meaning documents' to be fairly long -- the one or two sentence dictionary definition of a term isn't going to provide enough signal to distinguish between thousands and thousands of `term` meanings.\n",

Just like DocSim makes the assumption that words in a document tell us about the document's meaning, we're going to assume that the set of words that 'co-occur' within a small window around our term can tell us some thing about the meaning of that `term`. Remember that we're going to make this 'co-words' list (a.k.a. 'stripe') by looking at a large body of text. This stripe is our 'meaning document' in that it reflects all the kinds of situations in which our `term` gets used in real language. So another way to phrase our assumption is: we think `terms` that get used to complete lots of the same phrases probably have related meanings. This may seem like an odd assumption but computational linguists have found that it works surprisingly well in practice. Let's look at a toy example to build your intuition for why and how.\n",

One component of a 'smart implementation' involves thinking carefully both about how you define the \"basis vocabulary\" that forms your feature set (removing stopwords, etc). Another key idea is to use a data structure that facilitates distributed calculations. The DISCO implemetation further uses a sampling strategy, but that is beyond the scope of this assignment. \n",

    "\n",
    "* __a) short response:__ In question 3 you calculated the cosine similarity of pairs of words using the vector representation of their co-occurrences in a corpus. In the asynch videos about \"Pairs and Stripes\" you were introduced to an alternative strategy. Explain two ways that using these data structures are more efficient than 1-hot encoded vectors when it comes to distributed similarity calculations [__`HINT:`__ _Consider memory constraints, amount of information being shuffled, amount of information being transfered over the network, and level of parallelization._]\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) read provided code:__ The code below provides a streamined implementation of Document similarity analysis in Spark. Read through this code carefully. Once you are confident you understand how it works, answer the remaining questions. [__`TIP:`__ _to see the output of each transformation try commenting out the subsequent lines and adding an early `collect()` action_.]\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) short response:__ The second mapper function, `splitWords`, emits 'postings'. The list of all 'postings' for a word is also refered to as an 'inverted index'. In your own words, define each of these terms ('postings' and 'inverted index') based on your reading of the provided code. (*DITP by Lin and Dyer also contains a chapter on the Inverted Index although in the context of Hadoop rather than Spark. You may find the illustration in Chaprter 4 helpful in answering this question*).\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) short response:__ The third mapper, `makeCompositeKeys`, loops over the inverted index to emit 'pairs' of what? Explain what information is included in the composite key created at this stage and why it makes sense to synchronize around that information in the context of performing document similarity calculations. In addition to the information included in these new keys, what other piece of information will we need to compute Jaccard or Cosine similarity?\n",
    "\n",
    "* __e) short response:__ Out of all the Spark transformations we make in this analysis, which are 'wide' transformations and which are 'narrow' transformations. Explain."

    "> __a)__ The stripes approach is advantageous over pairs (i.e. the vector representation in question3) as 1. they can make better use of combiners and 2. far less shuffling and sorting\n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ _read provided code before answering d-f_ \n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ The \"posting\" is the output of a mapper that provides a key for each non-unique word and an associated value for where that key was generated from. The inverted index is the flattened/reduced list of documents and document lengths where that key is found, which then provides all the necessary mathematical components for later mapper/reducers to calculate the similiarity score (e.g. doc lengths, words in common) \n",
    "\n",
    "> __d)__ It emits pairs of documents that share a key (i.e. a word) in common along with an incremental counter to be summed in a reducer to determine the amount of words two documents share. The original key from the previous reducer is dropped at this stage as it is no longer useful since we now have a way to count how many words to documents have in common. The commposite key also contains each documents length which is needed in the similiarity scores (e.g. the magnitude of the doc vector in the cosine similarity)  \n",
    "\n",
    "> __e)__ The narrow transformations include \"splitWords\" and \"makeCompositeKey\" as these take wide inputs (e.g. a document/Ngram for splitwords and the inverted index for makeCompositeKey) and produce compact key-value pairs. Conversely, the first reduce by key is a wide transformation as it takes a narrow two column vector and transforms it into a flatter, much wider vector where information is captured in the value's in the keys instead of across multiple instances of the same key   "

    "Now that you are comfortable with similarity metrics we turn to the main task in this assignment: \"Synonym\" Detection. As you saw in Question 3 the ability of our algorithm to detect words with similar meanings is highly dependent on our input text. Specifically, we need a large enough corpus of natural language that we can expose our algorithm to a realistic range of contexts in which any given word might get used. Ideally, these 'contexts' would also provide enough signal to distinguish between words with similar semantic roles but different meaning. Finding such a corpus will be easier to accomplish for some words than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the main task in this portion of the homework you will use data from Google's n-gram corpus. This data is particularly convenient for our task because Google has already done the first step for us: they windowed over a large subset of the web and extracted all 5-grams. If you are interested in learning more about this dataset the original source is: http://books.google.com/ngrams/, and a large subset is available [here from AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/datasets/google-books-ngrams/). \n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment we have provided a subset of the 5-grams data consisting of 191 files of approximately 10MB each. These files are available in the 'data' folder in 'Assignments/HW3/' github.  Please only use the provided data so that we can ensure consistent results from student to student.\n",

Calculating pairs on this 5-gram is a little corrupt as we will be double counting cooccurences. Having said that this exercise can still pull out some similar terms."

Write a Spark job that will accomplish the three tasks below as efficiently as possible. (No credit will be awarded for jobs that sort or subset after calling `collect()`-- use the framework to get the minimum information requested). As you develop your code, systems test each job on the provided file with Dickens ngrams, then on a single file from the Ngram dataset before running the full analysis.\n",

If each term's stripe were 1000 words long, how many tuples would we need to shuffle in order to form the inverted indices? Show and briefly explain your calculations for each part of this question.

    "Every word that appears in our data is a potential feature for our synonym detection analysis. However as we've discussed, some are likely to be more useful than others. In this question, you'll choose a judicious subset of these words to form our 'basis vocabulary'. Practically speaking, this means that when we build our stripes, we are only going to keep track of when a term co-occurs with one of these basis words. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7 Tasks:\n",
    "* __a) multiple choice:__ Suppose we were deciding between two different basis vocabularies: the 1000 most frequent words or the 1000 least frequent words. How would this choice impact the quality of the synonyms we are able to detect? How does this choice relate to the ideas of 'overfitting' or 'underfitting' a training set?\n",
    "<pre>  \n",
    "  MULTIPLE CHOICE:\n",
    "   A. 1000 most frequent words would overfit, while 1000 least frequent words would underfit\n",
    "   B. 1000 most frequent words would underfit, while 1000 least frequent words would overfit\n",
    "  \n",
    "  BONUS: Explain your answer \n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "* __b) short response:__ If we had a much larger dataset, computing the full ordered list of words would be extremely expensive. If we need to none-the-less get an estimate of word frequency in order to decide on a basis vocabulary, what alternative strategy could we take?\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) multiple choice:__ Run the provided spark job that does the following:\n",
    "  * tokenizes, removes stopwords and computes a word count on the ngram data\n",
    "  * subsets the top 10,000 words (these are the terms we'll consider as potential synonyms)\n",
    "  * subsets words 9,000-9,999 (this will be our 1,000 word basis vocabulary)    \n",
    "  (to put it another way - of the top 10,000 words, the bottom 1,000 form the basis vocabulary)\n",
    "  * saves the full 10K word list and the 1K basis vocabulary to file for use in `d`.  \n",
    "<pre>\n",
    "  What is another way to describe the Basis Vocabulary in machine learning terms?\n",
    "  A. Stop-words\n",
    "  B. Features\n",
    "  C. Postings\n",
    "  D. 1000-grams\n",
    "</pre>\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) code:__ Write a spark job that builds co-occurrence stripes for the top 10K words in the ngram data using the basis vocabulary you developed in `part c`. This job/function, unlike others so far, should return an RDD (which we will then use in q8)."

    "# Question 8: Synonym Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "We're now ready to perform the main synonym detection analysis. In the tasks below you will compute cosine, jaccard, dice and overlap similarity measurements for each pair of words in our vocabulary and then sort your results to find the most similar pairs of words in this dataset. __`IMPORTANT:`__ When you get to the sorting step please __sort on cosine similarity__ only, so that we can ensure consistent results from student to student. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to test each step of your work with the small files before running your code on the full dataset. This is a computationally intense task: well designed code can be the difference between a 20min job and a 2hr job. __`NOTE:`__ _as you are designing your code you may want to review questions 3 and 4 where we modeled some of the key pieces of this analysis._\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q8 Tasks:\n",
    "* __a) short response:__ In question 7 you wrote a function that would create word stripes for each `term` in our vocabulary. These word stripes are essentially an 'embedded representation' of the `term`'s meaning. What is the 'feature space' for this representation? (i.e. what are the features of our 1-hot encoded vectors?). What is the maximum length of a stripe?\n",
    "\n",
    "* __b) short response:__ Remember that we are going to treat these stripes as 'documents' and perform similarity analysis on them. The first step is to emit postings which then get collected to form an 'inverted index.' How many rows will there be in our inverted index? Explain.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __c) short response:__ In the demo from question 2, we were able to compute the cosine similarity directly from the stripes (we did this using their vector form, but could have used the list instead). So why do we need the inverted index?\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) code:__ Write a spark job that does the following:\n",
    "  * loops over the stripes from Q7 and emits postings for the `term` _(key:term, value:posting)_   \n",
    "  * aggregates the postings to create an inverted index _(key:term, value:list of postings)_\n",
    "  * loops over all pairs of `term`s that appear in the same postings list and emits co-occurrence counts\n",
    "  * aggregates co-occurrences _(key:word pair, value:count + other payload)_\n",
    "  * uses the counts (along with the accompanying information) to compute the cosine, jacard, dice and overlap similarity metrics for each pair of words in the vocabulary \n",
    "  * retrieve the top 20 and bottom 20 most/least similar pairs of words\n",
    "  * also return the cached sorted RDD for use in the next question  \n",
    "  __`NOTE 1`:__ _Don't forget to include the stripe length when you are creating the postings & co-occurrence pairs. A composite key is the way to go here._  \n",
    "  __`NOTE 2`:__ _Please make sure that your final results are sorted according to cosine similarity otherwise your results may not match the expected result & you will be marked wrong._\n",
    "  \n",
    "* __e) code:__ Comment on the quality of the \"synonyms\" your analysis comes up with. Do you notice anything odd about these pairs of words? Discuss at least one idea for how you might go about improving on the analysis."

    "\n",
    "> __c)__ The inverted index is a useful technique for capturing info that can directly be fed into a reducer by key. The vector form in question 2 needs the entire vocabulary to calculate the similairity. For a sparse vector like cooccurence matrices, this is a computationally and storage intensive process.  \n",
    "\n",

To improve the quality of analysis, a list of compound phrases can be used to transform these sepearte words as one word phrase."
