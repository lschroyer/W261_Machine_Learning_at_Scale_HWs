    "Welcome to Machine Learning at Scale! This first homework assignment introduces one of the core strategies in distributed processing: divide and conquer. We'll use the simplest of tasks, word counting, to illustrate the difference between a scalable and non-scalable algorithm. You will be working with the text of _Alice in Wonderland_ to put these ideas into practice using Python and Bash scripting. By the end of this week you should be able to:\n",
    "* ... __describe__ the Bias-Variance tradeoff as it applies to Machine Learning.\n",
    "* ... __explain__ why we consider word counting to be an \"Embarrassingly Parallel\" task.\n",
    "* ... __estimate__ the runtime of embarrassingly parallel tasks using \"back of the envelope\" calculations.\n",
    "* ... __implement__ a Map Reduce algorithm using the Command Line.\n",
    "* ... __set-up__ a Docker container and know why we use them for this course.\n",

During the remote work life of 2020-2021 however I've been moving around quite a bit to visit different areas, including Hawaii, Utah, and New York. I just finished my first year of MIDS and expect to graduate summer 2022. I find data engineering to be really fascinating and look forward to learning how I can use the plumbing that is data engineering with the 'sexy' algorithms of machine learning. At work I have seen first hand how having parallel program could improve my model runtimes by orders of magnitude so hopefully after this course I can implement some of those solutions!

    "> The bias-variance trade off is a concept in machine learning and statistics at large where there is an theoretical minimum error term that can not be reduced further by increasing your model complexity, such as by increasing the polynomial term in a regression fit. The tradeoff can be summarized as follows: an increase in your model complexity will reduce the model variance (i.e. the error from sensitivity to small fluctuations in the training set), but will increase the model bias (i.e. bias error is an error from erroneous assumptions in the learning algorithm). The error term (i.e. the difference between a model's predicted value and the actual value) can be split into three terms: 1. the model's bias term, 2. the model's variance term, and 3. the minimum error term that occurs when the bias-variance tradeoff is optimized. In supervised machine learning, the biasâ€“variance tradeoff is the property of a model that the variance of the parameter estimates across samples can be reduced by increasing the bias in the estimated parameters. \n",

For example, you might choose to remove punctuation or to consider punctuation symbols  'tokens' in their own right. __In this question you'll use the Python `re` module to create a tokenizer to use when you perform WordCount on the _Alice In Wonderland_ text.__\n",

MapReduce provides an abstraction that isolates the programmer from system-level details and the sorting alogirthm only needs to be designed once and then can be scaled out.\n",

    "# Question 6: Parallel Word Count (part 1)\n",
    "What would happen if we tried to run our script on a much larger dataset? For one thing, it would take longer to run. However there is a second concern. The Python object that aggregates our counts (`defaultdict`) exists in memory on the machine running this notebook. If the vocabulary is too large for the memory space available we would crash the notebook. The solution? Divide and Conquer! Instead of running the script on the whole dataset at once, we could split our text up in to smaller 'chunks' and process them independently of each other. __In this question you'll use a bash script to \"parallelize\" your Word Count.__\n",

Read through this script to be sure you understand how it is written. Then follow the instructions in `pWordCount_v1.sh` to make a one-line modification so that it accepts `aggregateCounts_v1.py` as a 4th argument and uses this script to combine the chunk-ed word counts.

    "> __b)__ In pWordCount_v1, the reducer did not properly aggregate all of the sorted alice counts into a final alice count as they were not globally sorted but instead were only locally sorted in the mapper. To correct this, we've still presorted the mapper data alphabetically (to increase the sort efficiency of the reducer) and then merge sorted and finally updated the reducer so that it now properly aggregates all identical words like 'Alice'."

    "Congratulations, you've just implemented a Map-Reduce algorithm! From here on out, we'll refer to the two python scripts you passed to `pWordCount_v1.sh` as '_mapper_' and '_reducer_'. The bash script itself served as our '_framework_' -- it split up the original input, then ___mapped___ our word counting script on to each chunk, then ___aggregated (a.k.a. reduced)___ the resulting files by piping them into our collation script.  Unfortunately, as you may have realized already, there is a major scalability concern with this particular implementation. __In this question you'll fix our implementation of parallel word count so that it will be scalable.__\n",
    "\n",
    "__HINT:__ MapReduce uses the Merge-Sort algorithm under the hood. Linux `sort` command has a merge option which you can use to simiulate the MapReduce framework. Use the `man sort` command to find more information on this option. \n",

    "* __c) code:__ Write the main part of `aggregateCounts_v2.py` so that it takes advantage of the sorted input to add duplicate counts without storing the whole vocabulary in memory. Refer to the file docstring for more detailed instructions. Confirm that your implementation works by running it on both the test and true data files.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __d) short response:__ If you are paying close attention, this rewritten reducer sets us up for a truly scalable solution, but doesn't get us all the way there. In particular, while we chunked our data so it can be processed by multiple mappers, we're still streaming the entire dataset through one reduce script. If the vocabulary is too large to fit on a single computer, we might split the word counts in half after sorting them, then perform the reducing on two separate machines. Explain what could go wrong with this approach. (For now, ignore the question of how we'd sort a dataset that is too large to fit on a single machine and just focus on what might be wrong about the result of this split-in-half reducing).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* __e) short response:__ Can you come up with a different way of splitting up the data that would allow us to perform the reducing on separate machines without needing any postprocessing? This is a theoretical question -- don't worry if you don't know how to implement your idea in a bash script, just describe how you'd want to split the sorted counts into different files to be reduced separately."

    "> __d)__ I could see two issues with the suggested approach of splitting the post-mapped, sorted dataset in two and then passing to two reducers: 1. if we want to aggregate words like 'alice' and 'alices' with some custom regex logic in the reducer (e.g. strip plurarls in this case), we may accidentally bifracate the data in between two of these cases that occur where the data is set resulting in both cases being reported by the individual reducers; and 2. one reducer will have to know the state of the other reducer before exporting (i.e. there is an alphabetical order to which dataset must be printed first) so there would have to be some post processing of the data, which could signficantly prohibit scaling of this solution if we were to continue adding reducers (how would we handle 1000 reducers for example? who prints first?).\n",
    "\n",
    "> __e)__ Along with the split data, I would also pass the first and last words associated with each of the new bin so both reducers would have access to the edge cases of both data sets to address both issues I described. That way I could add some conditional logic to merge the 'alice' vs 'alices' example as well as some logic to batch reload the current print state of the final output so each reducer knows when it is time to execute/print.

    "> __a)__ The two components to strive for when designing an algorithm to achieve 'ideal behavior' are as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "        1. given twice the amount of data, the same algorithm should take at most twice as long to run, all else being equal\n",
    "        2. given a cluster twice the size, the same algorithm should take no more than half as long to run\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> __b)__ In testing Lin and Dyer's second feature with our demo mapper, we see that as we double the number of clusters available, the time to run is reduced by about half each time (i.e. we went from 4.8 ms to 2.5 ms to 1.4 ms with 1, 2, and 4 cores respectively), meeting the second of the ideal behavior criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> __c)__ when testing the same concept with our aggregateCounts_v2.py mapper, we do not see the same ideal behavior as we did with our demo mapper. Instead, we see the run time increase with the doubling of clusters available. This is likely due to the fact that: 1. there is not that much data in the Alice text file so one cluster is able to process all of the text fairly quickly and thus additional communication lag time associated with the multiple clusters hurts the runtime performance and 2.\n",

    "> __a)__ With regards to word counting, the problem can be categorized as embarrassingly parallel because very little effort is needed to seperate it into a number of parallel task, due to the fact that there is no shared state. The mapper task doesn't need to know how many words are being counted in the other map task and the single reducer task has all the context it needs to aggregate for any number of mapper tasks. The stages of the wordc count pipeline can be easily distributed to an arbitrary number of machines. \n",
